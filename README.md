# Risk
a custom variant of Risk [WIP]

If you played the classic version of this game then forget all those rules this game has no resemblence to those rules!

# Basics

Roll the dice to see how many movements you can advance. 

For example If you roll 3 for example you could pass one person up three countries, or you can alternatively move two groups of people - one up one country and another up two or three people up one country each, etc.

# Battles
The main gist of the game is that two people will kill one, three will killa two.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One unit / One infantry



Now a general is worth 10 people so 9 people will get killed by a General but 11 individual people will kill one General.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One General

Now this rule of greater units equal win don't apply to generals. So two Generals will not kill one General rather it would be the person with two generals will get two dice rolls whereas the other person will only get one dice roll. If someone has 5 generals then they get 5 dice rolls. 
However gets a higher dice roll wins. If it is a tie than nothing happens and a movment is consumed. 

## Cannons

Cannons are worth 0 units so 1 enemy infantry can take over a cannon.
Firing a cannon takes 0 turns however a cannon could only fire twice per turn. 
A cannon fires by killing one infantry on an adjacent country.
A cannon does no damage to generals or other cannons.

# Cards and tresures.

Each card is maked with a country and a unit to be gained (eg Infantry, General or Cannon) which you can place anywhere.
If you reach that country than you will get that unit on that card and also pick up another card. 

If you get a wild card than you get one of each Infantry General and Cannon as well as another card.
