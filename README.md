Work In Progress - Unfortunately only basic movement is available, with attack logic and multiplayer play still todo.
# Risk


If you played the classic version of this game then forget all those rules this game has no resemblance to those rules.

# Basics
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5521110/204102056-403e519b-bc14-4f45-8e49-a82d5446fb0b.png)

Roll the dice to see how many movements you can advance. Water ways just link where the adjecent countries are and make no difference to the movement of spaces consumed.

For example if you roll 3 you could pass one person up three countries, or you can alternatively move two groups of people - one up one country and another up two or three people up one country each, etc.

# Battles
The main gist of the game is that two people will kill one, three will killa two.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One unit / One infantry



Now a general is worth 10 people so 9 people will get killed by a General but 11 individual people will kill one General.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One General

Now this rule of greater units equal win doesn't apply to Generals. So two Generals will not kill one General rather it would be the person with two Generals will get two dice rolls whereas the other person will only get one dice roll. If someone has 5 Generals then they get 5 dice rolls.
Whoever gets a higher dice roll wins. If it is a tie then nothing happens but a movement is consumed anyways.

## Cannons

Cannons are worth 0 units so 1 enemy infantry or General can take over a cannon.
Firing a cannon takes 0 turns however a cannon could only fire twice per turn.
A cannon fires by killing one infantry on an adjacent country.
A cannon does no damage to Generals or other cannons. For initial game startup purposes or reward points one infantry is worth one point, one General is worth 10 points and one cannon is worth 5 points.


# Cards and treasures.

Each card is marked with a country and an unit to be gained (eg infantry, General or cannon) when you reach that country than you will get that unit on that card and also pick up another card. The unit you gained from that card can be placed on any country where you have other units on.

If you get a wild card, showing all three unit types and no territory than you get one of each: infantry, General, and cannon, as well as another card.

# Continental conquest.
If you have a unit in each of the spaces of a continent than you get that amount of units listed at the start of your turn which you can place anywhere.
